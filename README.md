## Thesis: ¨Software development for the assessment of the safety provided by typical grounding configurations of high-voltage installations"

MATLAB application for assessing the safety of typical grounding configurations in high-voltage installations based on IEEE and CELENEC standards.

## Abstract
The diploma thesis “Software development for the assessment of the safety provided by typical grounding configurations of high-voltage installations” deals with the development of appropriate software to assess the safety of grounding in high voltage installations against the danger of critical electric shock during a ground fault. The goal is to be able to assess the safety of grounding systems in detail, with accuracy and without the requirement of calculations by the user. The thesis consists of two parts, with the first one corresponding to the theoretical background and the basic concepts, the knowledge of which is considered essential. This part presents the methodology which will be implemented during software development. The second part corresponds to the technical specifications of the implementation, which make up the steps that should be performed as well as the final part of the implementation and development of the software. This tool is a useful addition for grounding safety, predicting hazards and reducing electrocution fatalities for personnel and the general public.
