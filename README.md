MATLAB application for assessing the safety of typical grounding configurations in high-voltage installations based on IEEE and CELENEC standards.

## Software development for the assessment of the safety provided by typical grounding configurations of high-voltage installations

# Description:
This repository contains the implementation of a software tool developed for the assessment of safety provided by typical grounding configurations of high-voltage installations. The software was developed in MATLAB and evaluates safety based on two standard grounding configurations: IEEE and CENELEC.

The application includes several features for the calculation of safety curves, time-current characteristics, and the analysis of specific points in the electrical grid. Users can input relevant variables such as soil resistivity, grid current, and other parameters to generate safety curves and evaluate whether the electrical system is safe under certain conditions.
